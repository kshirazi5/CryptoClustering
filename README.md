# CryptoClustering

Weâ€™ll use our knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

-Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

-Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

-Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame

-Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data

-Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

-Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data

-Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
